# RHEO Technology  
### A Professional Remote Work Platform  
Built by **Rheo Technologies**

---

## Overview

Life–Work Connect is a professionally designed web platform created to support legitimate, flexible, work-from-home opportunities. The platform focuses on clarity, trust, and real-world usability — avoiding hype-driven design in favor of a calm, credible, and human experience.

This project was **designed and engineered in-house by Rheo Technologies**, following modern frontend best practices and a strong emphasis on accessibility, performance, and long-term maintainability.

## Project Goals

- Deliver a clean, professional, non-gimmicky user interface

- Ensure responsiveness across all devices
- Create a strong foundation for future product expansion
- Emphasize trust, legitimacy, and usability

---

## Tech Stack

This project is built using a modern, production-ready frontend stack:

- **React** — component-driven UI architecture  
- **TypeScript** — type safety and long-term maintainability  
- **Vite** — fast development and optimized builds  
- **Tailwind CSS** — consistent, scalable styling system  
- **shadcn/ui** — accessible and composable UI primitives  

---

## Design Principles

- Consistent spacing, typography, and hierarchy  
- Rounded interface elements (`rounded-3xl`) across the system  
- Subtle, purposeful motion only where it adds clarity  
- No unnecessary animations or visual noise  
- Neutral, professional color palette  

Every design choice is intentional and serves usability first.
